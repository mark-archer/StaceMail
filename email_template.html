Hello PUBLISHER

My name is Ron and I’m part of the publisher development team at AerServ. I wanted to personally reach out and extend an exclusive offer to you.

AerServ is a mediation and monetization platform that provides various innovative, high-paying ad units. With a single SDK you’re able to plug into 50+ ad networks to truly maximize revenue and performance.  We've recently partnered with various large video providers and we're looking to place these high-paying campaigns in high-quality apps.

AerServ publishers are paid on CPM. Users can exit the video ad at any duration and you will still be paid for the impression as long as the ad fires. This is a huge plus for publishers as some other video competitors such as Vungle and Ad Colony only pay on completed views or installs.

 * Some requirements and highlights for this bonus:
 * Must integrate our lightweight SDK by 9/15 and implement our video ads.
 * Must have significant US traffic, we can still monetize your International traffic.
 * eCPM ranges from $6-12
 * Quick payment via Paypal, Check, Wire
 * Full control over ad unit behavior, frequency and campaign filtration.
 * 100% Google Play/AppStore compliant
 * Preserve user experience with our non intrusive ad units.
 * Up to $2,000 bonus

Please advise ASAP if you’re interested as this is a time sensitive offer, should you not be interested this bonus will be offered to the next publisher.

*Bonus is dependent on volume of traffic and GEO.

Looking forward to working with you!
